### • Best Game Settings:

To get good performance, you may need to tweak the settings of the game a little bit to run best on your machine. They are fairly optimized from the beginning but may require additional modification to run best on your computer.

### • Performance Issues:

Playing such a large modpack can come with some performance issues, so related to the following:

#### • Chunks are slowly loading, or not loading at all.

If this occurs, try increasing the "Chunk Update Threads" option in settings.

* If chunks around you are not loading at all, you may want to reload them. You can do this by pressing the following buttons: **F3+A**

#### • My FPS is Dropping.

FPS Dropping can be a varity of things, from having too many block updates in one chunk, too many entites, or your graphics settings are too high. If you experience FPS drops, try this:

* Turn your "Entity Render Distance" to 125%
* Change "Graphics" from Fancy to Fast
* Disable Smooth Lighting
* Decrease your Render Distance. (10-12 Recommended)
* Disable Particles

#### • Game Latency is High

A slowly responding game is a big issue. To resolve this, follow these steps:

* Disable Particles
* Make sure there are no "Lag Machines" that could possibly be causing this issue
* Restart your game to clear caches, items, etc.

### • Shaders:

When playing Expanded Vanilla, you can play with Shaders if you would like but we advise against it. This puts a significant strain on your computer. If your computer can handle it, feel free to run shaders.

If you are experiencing issues with your shaders, then follow this guide:

* Make sure your shaders are up-to-date.
* If you are experiencing visual errors, press R to reload them
* If your errors continue, we advise you disable your shaders.
